      <SubHeading>What sets Farm Botanica apart?</SubHeading>
        <ol>
          <li>
              Multi-Layered Quality assessment and management <br/>
              Products undergo quality checking before and after processing to assess the difference in quality. Another 	layer of quality inspection and quarantine check happens right before packaging.
          </li>
          <li>Handling Efficiency <br/>
                We work with farmers, up and all the way until the products reach their shipment destinations. In order to 	conserve the natural resources, Farm Botanica strives hard to minimize post-harvest losses and wastage. 

          </li>
          <li>
